#    any formatting for consistent looks and for future safety)

#    E203: whitespace before ':'
# 3. Q003 ("Change outer quotes to avoid escaping inner quotes")
# 4. E501 "line too long" (covered by black)
# 5. F841 (covered by pylint)
# 6. W291 (trailing-whitespace)
# 7. W293 (blank line contains whitespace)
