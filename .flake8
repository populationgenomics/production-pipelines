# We disable the following inspections:
# 1. F541: f-string is missing placeholders (we allow f-strings that don't do
#    any formatting for consistent looks and for future safety)
# 2. Inspections incompatible with Black (see https://github.com/psf/black/blob/master/docs/compatible_configs.md#why-those-options-above-1):
#    E203: whitespace before ':'
# 3. Q003 ("Change outer quotes to avoid escaping inner quotes")
# 4. E501 "line too long" (covered by black)
# 6. W291 (trailing-whitespace)
# 7. W293 (blank line contains whitespace)
# 8. E227 (missing whitespace around bitwise or shift operator)
# 9. E125 (continuation line with same indent as next logical line - covered by PyCharm)
# 10. F401 imported but unused (covered by PyCharm)
