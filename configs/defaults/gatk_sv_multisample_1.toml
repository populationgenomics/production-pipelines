# switches to deactivate all Metrics workflows. We ran into some resourcing issues when our total
# cohort size approached ~1600. Response when raised with GATK team:
#
# "GatherBatchEvidenceMetrics and the other metrics routines at the end of the main workflows are
# primarily for development and testing purposes, so you donâ€™t need to run them as a user"

# these metrics workflows are typically running svtest (https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv/blob/d37e453038e425acba9683da503218fe3d4b1033/src/svtest/setup.py)
# on each output of the stage, producing output files containing a count/distribution of different variants
# and sizes. The workflow files we are using as Stages do not always capture these results as top-level outputs,
# so we have no reliable method to extract these files into permanent storage.
