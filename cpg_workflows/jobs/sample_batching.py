    Batch sequencing groups by coverage, and chrX ploidy

    Starts with a base assumption of one batch, increasing the batch count
    until min < batch size < max

    When an appropriate number of batches is found, the SGs are split
    by sex (assigned by inferred X ploidy), then all SGs are ordered
    by median coverage.

    Using numpy.array_split, the ordered male & female sample lists are split
    into equal sized sub-lists, then the sub-lists are combined into batches.
    This groups lowest coverage male and female samples into a single batch,
    continuing up to the highest coverage batch.

    This method maintains a consistent sex ratio across all batches
